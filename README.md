## Learning Outcomes and Challenges  :-

There were many challenges I faced during the developement of the app and in that the major issue I faced in the deploying the app to github pages as it was my first time deploying an app so it was a bit challenging but now I am capable of the act of deployement.

Along with that this project helped me to understant the react better and how to write the production ready code too.
